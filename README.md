Just a custom startpage with links and some CSS fluff.

## Motivation
I wanted to make my new tab page useful with commonly used links.
I was inspired by the [Startpage Emporium](https://startpages.github.io) and edited [jad340's startpage](https://startpages.github.io/startpages/startpage-jad340/) by adding some CSS changes and colors to match my system theme.

## Installation
The simplest way is to clone this git directory and have your browser redirect its home and new tab page to the html file.
